      <h1>Hello, I'm Viddy!</h1>

      <img class="img-circle" src="images/Profile pic.jpg" alt="An image of a beautiful man.">

      <p>My hobbies are camping, cycling, hiking, playing board games with my friends, and more recently, learning how to code. Currently studying at Le Wagon Tokyo.</p>

      <h2>Camping</h2>
      <p class="justified">With the advent of the "novel" (by the way, how long until this "novel" tag drops?) coronavirus 🦠, camping is one of the few things I have been able to physically enjoy with my friends. Nagatoro and Okutama are areas that are easily reachable by bicycle and have great camping sites. My current setup is an Amok Draumr 🌌, a hammock which I can hang anywhere that has two solid anchor points that can hold my weight. With a lightweight tarp overhead, I am usually well protected from the weather, with a nice breeze cooling me off in the summer and an underquilt to keep me warm in the winter.</p>

      <h2>Cycling</h2>
      <p class="justified">My current setup is a <en>Cannondale Topstone Sora</en> with a rack in the back to which I attach two panniers. It's a gravel bike, so it works well on dirt roads as well as on streets. I changed the saddle for a <en>Brooks</en> saddle for more comfort on those long touring rides 🚵🏻</p>

      <h2>Hiking</h2>
      <p class="justified">When cycling is not an option (either the end destination is too far from the starting point or is in a different country), hiking is also very enjoyable, especially when paired with a night out under the stars.</p>

    <div class="card-white">
      <h2>Board Games</h2>
      <p class="justified">I used to meet my friends on a weekly basis to play boardgames after work before COVID-19, but now have to resign to playing with them online. Although it doesn't have the same social warmth in-person sessions do, it is great fun. Some of my favourite board games at the moment are Root 🦊, Blood on the Clocktower 🩸, and John Company 🫖.</p>

      <p class="text-center">Seriously, I don't have any presence on social media except for Github and LinkedIn.</p>
